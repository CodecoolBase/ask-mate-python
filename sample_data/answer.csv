Drooling is often a sign of relaxation and contentment. Drooling while happy and relaxed often goes back to kittenhood. While nursing, kittens often knead their paws on their mothers to stimulate milk release. These behaviors result in a comforting and satisfying meal as well as a nurturing bond between mother and kitten. When cats reach adulthood, feelings of contentment often lead to kneading, which then stimulates drooling because of the connection to nursing. Purring often accompanies the kneading and drooling.",https://www.thesprucepets.com/thmb/MpaLdH2Et-mx-l6X1MBjiUnijxo=/960x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():format(webp)/cutest-cats-on-the-internet-4-57eeab3c5f9b586c3549f9c2.jpeg

They originate from the Near East countries where they were domesticated from wild cats to help control rodent populations. These cats spread throughout the world as pets and we eventually started selectively breeding them for specific traits, thus creating different breeds. The primary cat breeds were originally bred using cats from four major regions; the Arabian Sea, the Eastern Mediterranean, South Asia, and Western Europe. These four regions have produced cats that have different genetic markers based on what region, or race, they are from.",

His home in Key West, Florida, where he wrote some of his best books, is now a museum that houses descendants of Ernest Hemingway's first polydactyl cat, Snow White, as well as other cats with extra toes.",
